The word acsint is shorthand for accessibility intercepter,
since the acsint system intercepts kernel events and makes the linux computer
more accessible to a wide range of disabilities.
The concept was developed by Saqib Shaikh in 2005, but did not
become practical until notifiers came on the scene in kernel 2.6.26.

There are two parts to the acsint system,
A device driver, which is documented in drivers/acsint.txt,
and a user space bridge layer, which is documented in bridge/acsbridge.h.
No need for me to repeat all that documentation here.

The tests directory contains a few test programs to exercise acsint,
without relying on any particular speech synthesizer.

I hope the device driver becomes part of the linux kernel, and the bridge
layer becomes a shared library, offered by many linux distributions.
That's my dream anyways.

It's all GPL, so have fun with it.
